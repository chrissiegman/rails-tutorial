# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is a microblog application similar to Twitter with secure
User authentication, scalable infrastructure, and a full suite
of automated tests.

Website implemented here:
[My Sample App](https://sheltered-island-5311.herokupp.com)

I created this site using the 
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).
